DESCRIPTION FOR THE TASK 1 : The goal of this project is to develop an *ETL pipeline* that automates the process of extracting data from a source, preprocessing and transforming it, and loading it into a target destination (e.g., a CSV file or database). The pipeline is implemented using Python and popular libraries like *Pandas* and *Scikit-learn*.

#### *Key Features*
1. *Data Extraction*:
   - Reads data from a CSV file (raw_data.csv).
2. *Data Preprocessing*:
   - Handles missing values by removing rows with null data.
   - Removes duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
3. *Data Transformation*:
   - Scales numerical features using *StandardScaler* from Scikit-learn.
   - Encodes categorical features using *OneHotEncoder* from Scikit-learn.
4. *Data Loading*:
   - Saves the processed data to a new CSV file (processed_data.csv).
   - Optionally loads the data into a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL
